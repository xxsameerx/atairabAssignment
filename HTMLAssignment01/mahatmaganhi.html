            <p>Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India.
                All throughout his life, he was guided by nonviolent beliefs.
                Bapu struggled greatly and gave up a lot of his personal
                possessions in his journey to free India from British rule, but
                he never wavered from his nonviolent beliefs.</p>
            <p>His legal career took him to South Africa, where he fought
                against racial injustice. He married Kasturba at the age of
                thirteen and continued his schooling in London. Gandhi used
                nonviolence in various movements during India’s war for
                independence, including the Champaran and Kheda movements, the
                Non-cooperation Movement, the Salt March, and the Quit India
                Movement. His influence was felt all around the world,
                motivating figures like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King
                Jr.</p>
            <p>Gandhi made contributions to secularism, environmental
                sustainability and social transformation. His legacy is firmly
                based on his nonviolence (Ahimsa) ideology. On January 30, 1948,
                he was murdered, yet his influence lives on, earning him the
                title of renowned “Father of the Nation and Bapu” in India’s
                history. His legacy will live on forever, inspiring future
                generations with his words and example.</p>
